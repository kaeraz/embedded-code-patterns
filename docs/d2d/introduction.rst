Introduction
------------
**Devices to Devices** (**D2D**) is a library for communication
from **Devices** to **Devices**. It uses single write hardware
connection that reduces amount cables. The library supports
a Mutli-Point (Mutli-Master) topology and it is easy to used
with different microcontrollers. The application protocol can
be defined, as it is not imposed on the user. The Physical Layer
implementation depends completely on the uses, so that the library
may be used to transmit data by serial interfaces and wireless
interfaces as well.

It is intended for the embedded systems like:

    - IoT devices
    - Various types of robots
    - Home Appliance devices (Washers, Dryers, Fridges, ..)
    - etc.

that contain or interface several Nodes.

The main features of the **D2D** are:

    - Portability (written in simple C)
    - Multi-master (Multi-point) solution (any device can send to any device with
      one common cable for all)
    - Reduction of hardware connections (simple transmission and reception
      circuit)
    - Supports frames collision and handling
    - Layered design easy to plug-in on each level
