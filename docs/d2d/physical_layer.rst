Layer 1: Physical Layer
*****************************************

Overview
--------
Example solution of **L1** uses standard **UART interface** for sending signals
between the devices. This decision gives simplicity and enables
easy portability of the software for different microcontrollers. The
simpliest hardware connection between the Nodes is shown following.

The **Physical Layer** implementation depends completely on the use cases, so
that one can utilize different transmission medium like wireless or
wire serial communication.
