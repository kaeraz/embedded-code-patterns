Topic introduction
------------------
Nature of a typical software developer is fickle. One starts a project,
and in a big hurry rushes to code. The code grows and when contain
a thousand of lines it becomes obvious that it may be worth to care about its
documentation. A documentation is uncommon and festive, like a salary, once
in a month, and usually misused. Lots of engineers suffers from missing
documentation - they who develops needs to share with their coworkers, they
who maintain the product have to worry about the code quality and consistency.
But, how can one be consistent if nobody instructed him why this particular
functionality has that shape? How one can extend the functionality having
only its intuition of what the current implementation is. Correct documentation
can be a solution...

Documentation
-------------
Project may have several documentation documents, where the following are
the common ones:

- **Customer Specification**

  + Shows customer's point of view.
  + Describes customer's wishes.
  + Usually not consistent and incomplete.
  + Is maintained by the customer.

- **Product Description**

  + Shows the contractor's understanding of the **Customer Specification**
  + Is complete and concise
  + Is enough and shows what is the subject of the contract
  + Is a base for the other contractor's documents
  + Is maintained by the contractor with support and consent of the customer

- **Software Architecture**

  +
