Embedded system documentation

----------
Background
----------

In all my years as a programmer I participated in several huge embedded
software projects. A huge project, in my view, stands for a multi-board project
with many of variants e.g. board to board combinations, that development lasts
over a year or two. This kind of projects involve several software teams,
dedicated separately to each board, group of requirement engineers, and bunch
of other people, and finally, so called managers...

Working in such project and environment:

- Requires expensive complexity management
- Requires multi-level system engineering
- Suffers from communication and synchronization issues between the teams
- Needs constant and proper contractor-customer communication
- Depends on customer product specification maturity
- Requires good systems, subsystems and code documentation

There are many reasons why such a project may fail, get abandoned or rejected.
Most of the IT projects does not succeed in terms of time and money. However,
I do not want to yammer about a project issues, my todays goal is to elaborate
a bit on software development documentation.
