----------

In all my years as a programmer I was participating in several huge embedded
software projects. A huge project, in my view, stands for a multi-board project
with many of variants e.g. board to board combinations, which development lasts
over a year. This kind of project involves several teams of software engineers,
dedicated to the board each, group requirements engineers, and bunch of other
engineers and managers...
